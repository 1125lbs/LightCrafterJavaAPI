LightCrafterJavaAPI
===================

For anyone trying to decipher the TI LightCrafter, here is a custom API written in Java. This implementation supports static image and pattern sequence modes, setting both displays modes and support for sending bitmap files to both display modes. A class, LightCrafterController.java is the API, while the class Client.java is an example of how to use it.
